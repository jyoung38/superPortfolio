2. or you can run the html code in VS code bebug and it will open the webpage. 
3. or if its in a sub-directory you will have to navigate to that directory

2. When you first open the page you will see my name, the field I want to go into, about me, links, list of my skills, a dog picture, my experiences, a timeline, and a message box.
3. as the site is very simple you can navigate just by scrolling up or down

Features:

The only feature I have on my website is the message box/form box.
